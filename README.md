# Data-Analysis-Power-BI-Project-
This project involved building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze 27K+ BigBasket products by ratings and pricing. Added calculated fields like discount % and rating buckets to uncover insights on product value. The dashboard includes KPIs and visual comparisons to support decisions in marketing, pricing, and inventory.

# BigBasket Product Performance Analysis
## 1. Problem Statement
As a data analyst for a retail store aggregator working for BigBasket, our goal is to analyze   product performance analysis to understand which brands and product categories perform best based on customer ratings and pricing. This analysis helps BigBasket identify top-performing products and brands based on ratings and pricing, enabling smarter promotions, better inventory decisions, and improved customer satisfaction by promoting highly rated, value-for-money products and optimizing low-performing ones. This can boost customer trust, increase repeat purchases, and drive overall sales growth.
